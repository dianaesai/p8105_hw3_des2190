This is my solution to HW3.

### Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables (user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour). There
are also item variables (name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes).

How many aisles, and which are most items from? The following code
counts the number of times an aisle is listed and orders it from largest
to smallest number.

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

There are 134 aisles and the one where most items are from is fresh
vegetables.

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

The following code creates a plot, organizes the x-axis labels, reorders
the x-axis points according to n from smallest to largest.

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    filter(n > 10000) %>% 
    mutate(
        aisle = factor(aisle),
        aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    count(product_name) %>%
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
    filter(rank < 4) %>% 
    arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    ) %>%
knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

| product\_name    |        0 |        1 |        2 |        3 |        4 |        5 |        6 |
| :--------------- | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: | -------: |
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77419 | 14.31579 | 15.38095 | 15.31818 | 15.21739 | 12.26316 | 13.83333 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44118 | 11.36000 | 11.70213 | 14.25000 | 11.55172 | 12.78431 | 11.93750 |

## Problem 2

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.

## Problem 3

Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month, and
day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and snowfall
are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the most commonly
observed values? Why?

Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January and
in July in each station across years. Is there any observable /
interpretable structure? Any outliers?

Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
(note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make a
plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0 and less
than 100 separately by year.
